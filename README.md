Go/Java/C++ is what we refer as a statically typed language.
Javascript/Ruby/Python are examples of Dynamic Types languages
With Go, when we define a variable, we assign it a type. The type is specific on whether it is string or integer. 

Go is always going to expect us to label that type of data that is being exchanged around out different function inside of our progamme. 

An array can be thought of as a very basic or very primitive data structure for holding list of records. It is Fixed length list of things. Slice is an array that can grow or shrink.

Every element in a splice must be of same type.


Go Types 

Bool = true/false
string = "Hi" "Hows it going"
int = 0 -1000 9999
float64 = 10.00001 0.0008 -100.003
